**Stockmarket predictor**

Predicts next day S&P500 opening (up or down) based on closing prices from various global indices and other indicators such as the volatility index.

Note; this code is ***VERY*** hacky and experimental plus has some code copied from a few different sources so style and naming standards vary across the project. Please don't shoot me, I just haven't had time to do a big clean up and refactor ;-)
